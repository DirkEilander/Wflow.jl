# Step 3: Preparing the input data

As mentioned before, the input data can be classified into two types:

 - Meteorological forcing: maps with timeseries for each model pixel, with values for precipitation, temperature, and potential evaporation. This data should be provided as a three-dimensional dataset, with the `x`, `y` and `time` dimensions. 
 - Static maps


## Meterological data

Meteorological data is provided as a single NetCDF file, with several variables containing the forcing data for precipitation, temperature and potential evaporation. The code snippet below shows the contents of the example file (downloaded [here](@ref wflow_sbm_data)), and opened with `xarray` in Python. As can be seen, each variable consists of a three-dimensional dataset (`lon`, `lat`, and `time`), and each timestep consists of a two-dimensional map with values at each gridcell. Only values within the basin are required.

```
<xarray.Dataset>
Dimensions:  (lon: 291, lat: 313, time: 366)
Coordinates:
  * lon      (lon) float64 5.429 5.438 5.446 5.454 ... 7.821 7.829 7.837 7.846
  * lat      (lat) float32 50.42 50.41 50.4 50.4 ... 47.85 47.84 47.83 47.82
  * time     (time) datetime64[ns] 2000-01-01 2000-01-02 ... 2000-12-31
Data variables:
    P        (time, lat, lon) float32 ...
    TEMP     (time, lat, lon) float32 ...
    PET      (time, lat, lon) float32 ...
```

## Static data


### List of essential static data

The list below contains a brief overview of several essential static maps required to run wflow. These NC variables names refer to the example data of the wflow\_sbm model (see [here](@ref wflow_sbm_data)).

Description | NC variable name | unit
--- | --- | ---
Altitude | `wflow_dem` | m
Number of upstream pixels (accuflux) | `wflow_acc` | -
Location of gauges | `wflow_gauges` | -
Map with landuse classes | `wflow_landuse` | -
Flow direction (1-9) | `wflow_ldd` | -
Location of cells that are pits | `wflow_pits` | -
Map indicating the river cells (0-1) | `wflow_river` | -
Drainage length, distance to nearest drain? | `wflow_riverlength` | m?
The width of the river | `wflow_riverwidth` | m
Location of soil pixels | `wflow_soil` | -
Streamorder (Strahler) of each pixel | `wflow_streamorder` | -
Mask of the basin (not related to gauges?) | `wflow_subcatch` | -
Area upstream of each pixel | `wflow_uparea` | m2?

As mentioned before, the model parameters can also be defined a spatial maps. They can be included in the same NetCDF file, as long as their variable names are correctly mapped in the TOML settings file.
