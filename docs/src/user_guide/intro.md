# About the user guide

The purpose of this user guide to describe the steps to install the wflow julia software and set up a simple model. Describing in a step-wise process how to configure your model using the TOML file and the gridded datasets (NETCDF = .nc).

Sample data and model set up is also included for the Moselle River Basin (a major tributary of the Rhine River), which can be used to explore the model software. The model is set up for the wflow-sbm, wflow-hbv, wflow-sediment and wflow-sbm+groundwater flow concepts.

Finally information is provided on setting up your own model, including building a model from scratch or alternatively using Deltares HydroMT model building tools which are open source.
