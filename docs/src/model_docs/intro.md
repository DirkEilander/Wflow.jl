# About the model documentation

As opposed to the user guide, which describes the steps needed to build and apply a model in the software, This section explains the different model concepts that are available within the modelling framework of wflow. Descriptions are given regarding the model concepts with links to the original scientific papers which explain the concepts in more detail. The model parameters which influence the processes are also shown, using inline code blocks. An overview of all model parameters is also provided for easy reference, including their short names, long descriptions and their units (see parameters vertical concepts and parameters lateral concepts).

## Division between vertical and lateral
In the documentation we talk of 'vertical' and 'lateral' concepts. These are components in the model concepts which describe the vertical movement of water in each model grid cell and the lateral movement of water across grid cells.
