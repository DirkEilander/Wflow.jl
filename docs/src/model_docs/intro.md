# About the model documentation

This section explains the different model concepts present within the modelling framework of wflow. If possible, the text refers to scientific papers which explain the concepts in more detail. If possible (and relevant), model parameters which influence the processes are also shown, using inline `code blocks`. These parameters can be found in the section with an overview of all model parameters, which also includes their units: see [parameters vertical concepts](@ref params_vert) and [parameters lateral concepts](@ref params_lat).
